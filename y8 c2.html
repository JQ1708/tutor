                question: "1. Explain the difference between the terms transparent and opaque.",
                answer: "<strong>Transparent</strong> materials allow you to see through them clearly (e.g., clear plastic). <strong>Opaque</strong> materials do not allow light to pass through, so you cannot see through them (e.g., milk, metal)."

                answer: "<strong>Dissolving</strong> involves two substances: a solute that dissolves into a solvent. <strong>Melting</strong> involves only one substance changing from a solid to a liquid due to heat."

                answer: "Marcus did not conduct a fair test. He used different volumes of water for each solute, so he cannot reliably compare their solubilities.",

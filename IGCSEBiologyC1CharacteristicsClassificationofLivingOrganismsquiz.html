                <h3>MRS GREN</h3>
                <p>To remember the seven characteristics that all living things share, we use the acronym <strong>MRS GREN</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>M</strong>ovement: An action by an organism causing a change of position or place.</li>
                    <li><strong>R</strong>espiration: The chemical reactions in cells that break down nutrient molecules and release energy.</li>
                    <li><strong>S</strong>ensitivity: The ability to detect and respond to changes in the environment (stimuli).</li>
                    <li><strong>G</strong>rowth: A permanent increase in size and dry mass.</li>
                    <li><strong>R</strong>eproduction: The processes that make more of the same kind of organism.</li>
                    <li><strong>E</strong>xcretion: Removal of waste products of metabolism and substances in excess of requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>N</strong>utrition: Taking in of materials for energy, growth and development.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some non-living things, like a fire, might show some of these characteristics, but only truly living organisms show all seven!</p>

                <h3>How We Name Organisms</h3>
                <p>To avoid confusion with common names, biologists use a universal two-part naming system, invented by Carl Linnaeus. This is the <strong>Binomial System</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every species is given a scientific name with two parts.</li>
                    <li>The first part is the <strong>Genus</strong> name. It is always capitalised. A genus is a group of closely related species.</li>
                    <li>The second part is the <strong>species</strong> name. It is always in lowercase.</li>
                    <li>The whole name is written in <i>italics</i> or <u>underlined</u>. For example, humans are <i>Homo sapiens</i>.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What is a Species?</h3>
                <p>A species is a group of organisms that can reproduce with each other to produce <strong>fertile offspring</strong> (offspring that can also reproduce).</p>

                <p>Viruses are fascinating, but strange. They are not classified in any of the five kingdoms of life because they exist on the border between living and non-living.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Viruses are not cells. They are much smaller and simpler. They consist of a strand of genetic material (either DNA or RNA) enclosed within a protective protein coat called a <strong>capsid</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not 'Alive':</strong> On their own, viruses cannot do anything. They do not show the 7 characteristics of life (MRS GREN). They can't move, respire, grow, or reproduce by themselves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> To reproduce, a virus must infect a living <strong>host cell</strong>. It injects its genetic material, which hijacks the cell's machinery, forcing it to make thousands of new viruses. The cell then bursts, releasing the new viruses to infect other cells.</li>
